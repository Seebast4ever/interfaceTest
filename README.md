# interfaceTest
Github stuff:
1. Make a new git repository. There are multiple ways of doing this, agree with your neighbors which way you should do this.
2. Name the repo interfaceTest
3. Clone the repository locally so you can add the base java files. At this point I assume you are using appropriate git workflow. I will just talk about your lab now.

Lab:
1. Write the two interfaces:
The Area interface requires :      double getArea()
The Volume Interface requires:    double getVolume()
2. Modify the classes to implement the appropriate interface. Start by implementing Area in the Circle and Rectangle, and test your code with the driver provided. 
Explain what the driver is doing.
